    <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
    </ol>

    <h2> Inline Elements </h2>
    <p><em>Sometimes </em> you need to draw attention to a particular word</p>
    <p> Other times, you need to <strong>strongly </strong> emphasize the importance of a word or a phase</p>

    <h2> Empty Elements</h2>
    <p>Thanks for Reading! Interneting should get easier now!</p>
